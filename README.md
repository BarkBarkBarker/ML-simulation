### project for final qualifying work of a bachelor in *SPb university* of student *Burlak Alexey*


# Architecture of project

- *models/* - folder with simulink models, made in special converter
- *SimFunc.m* - class-colection of main functions 
    This class got set of constant properties to control what to show in console; 
    they named show_*smth*
- *TestRun.m* - script to run simulation with given parameters and plot graphs
- *DataGenerator.m* - script to run data generation and export it
- *data.mat* - binary collection of data for neural network
