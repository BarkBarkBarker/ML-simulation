# Machine Learning simulations analysis
### Project for final qualifying work of a bachelor in *SPb university* of student *Burlak Alexey*
## Architecture of project
##### Folders
- *Literature materials/* - folder of literature helpful for work
- *ML Library/* - folder with machine learning library, made by Alexey Merkushev
- *json/* - folder of .json version of models
- *models/* - folder with simulink models, made in special converter, and binary versions of neural networks model from "ML library" and Deep Learning Toolbox
- *data/* - folder with binary data files, generated by DataCollector, contains unfiltered and filtred (without '_unfiltered') types of data
***
#### Scripts
- *SimFunc.m* - class-colection of main functions 
    <br/>This class got set of constant properties to control what to show in console; 
    <br/>they named like show_*smth*
- *test_run_single_fault_with_plot.m* - script to run simulation with given parameters and plot graphs

- *DataCollector.m* - script to run data generation and export it

- *LearnMLLIB.m* - script to work with "ML library"; load data, separate proportion of train data, and train model

- *LoadFormatData.m* - script to load data and make it in format for DLT, with possibility of separating data from one model

- *LearnDLT.m* - script to work with "Deep learning toolbox"; separate proportion of train data, and train model; requiers data in workspace, generated by LoadFormatData.m

- *phasor_fluctuation.m* - script to create andd train model from DLT, which then test with fluctuated data of phasors
